## About
> Dockerized started template for Laravel + Nuxt.JS comfortable development.

## Installation
// todo

## Usage
For using Laravel api from Nuxt.JS application, you must add **_/api_** prefix for all API requests.

**_Axios_** module must use 8080 port in its configuration (nuxt.config.js)
```
  /*
   ** Axios module configuration
   ** See https://axios.nuxtjs.org/options
   */
  axios: {
    port: 8080
  }, 
```

### Logs

All **_nginx_** logs are available inside _docker/nginx/logs_ directory

All **_supervisor_** logs are available inside _docker/supervisor/logs_ directory

Other logs is available with commands:
```
docker-compose logs
docker-compose logs <container>
```

## Available containers
* Nginx (as proxy resolver between Laravel and Nuxt)
* PHP-FPM version 7.3
* Node version 12.4 (For SSR)
* Redis
* PostgreSQL version 11.3
* Supervisor with queue and schedule
* Mailhog for easy SMTP testing
* NODE-CLI for front-end workspace
* PHP-CLI for back-end workspace


#### Makefile
For example, to start all docker containers you may use:
```
make up
```

Feel free to explore it, there are some useful commands for comfortable development.

#### Aliases
Also, there are _aliases.sh_ file which you can apply with command:
```
source aliases.sh
```
For example, it helps to execute commands from containers a little simpler:

Instead of
```
docker-compose exec php-cli artisan migate
```
Now available 'from' alias
```
from php-cli artisan migate
```

**If you want to reinstall laravel from scratch with the fresh version, use the following commands:**

Remove the old laravel directory and create the new empty one
```
sudo rm -rf api
mkdir api
```

Restart docker containers to allow to remount the new just created 'api' directory
```
docker-compose restart
```

Install laravel inside the container working directory (our just created api directory on the previous step)
```
docker-compose exec php-cli composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel .
```

Give permissions for all files and directories generated by docker user to current user
```
sudo chown ${USER}:${USER} -R api
```

Set up laravel permissions
```
sudo chmod -R 777 api/bootstrap/cache
sudo chmod -R 777 api/storage
```

Update environment variables and generate laravel application key
```
sudo rm api/.env
cp .env api/.env
docker-compose exec php-cli php artisan key:generate 
```

Install redis php client
```
docker-compose exec php-cli composer require predis/predis
```

Open http://localhost:8081 and make sure it works

**If you want to reinstall Nuxt.JS from scratch with the fresh version, use the following commands:**

Remove the old nuxt directory and create the new one
```
sudo rm -rf client
mkdir client
```

Restart docker containers to allow to remount the new just created 'client' directory
```
docker-compose restart
```

Create the new nuxt project with preferable configurations (no custom server framework, universal rendering mode, yarn package manager)
```
docker-compose exec node-cli yarn create nuxt-app .
```

Give permissions for all files and directories generated by docker user to current user
```
sudo chown ${USER}:${USER} -R client
```

Restart docker containers again for executing fresh nuxt instance
```
docker-compose restart
```

Open http://localhost:8080 and make sure it works


### TODO LIST:
- add installation instructions
- add commands for postgres and redis usage
- add image to readme.md with connected containers and workflow explaining 
- add other containers (selenium, laravel-echo-server)
- add instructions about testing (and generate .env.testing file)
- reinstall laravel and nuxt with fresh and empty templates
- migrate to SSL and probably HTTP2
- find and replace all hardcoded values with ENV variables
