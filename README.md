### TODO LIST:
- add other containers (selenium, echo-server)
- add instructions about reinstallation nuxt and laravel with fresh versions
- migrate to SSL and probably HTTP2
- add instructions about axios usage

- add commands for postgres and redis usage

**If you want, you can reinstall fresh laravel version with the following commands:**

Remove old laravel directory
```
sudo rm -rf api
```

Create new empty directory (name must be 'api' because it mounts inside docker-containers)
```
mkdir api
```

Restart docker containers to allow to remount the new 'api' directory
```
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

Install laravel inside the container working directory (our just created api directory on the previous step)
```
docker-compose exec php-cli composer create-project --prefer-dist laravel/laravel .
```

Give permissions for all files and directories generated by docker user to current user
```
sudo chown ${USER}:${USER} -R api
```

Set up laravel permissions
```
sudo chmod -R 777 api/bootstrap/cache
sudo chmod -R 777 api/storage
```

Open http://localhost:8081 and make sure it works

**If you want, you can reinstall fresh laravel version with the following commands:**

```
yarn create nuxt-app client
```

Restart node container for executing fresh nuxt build process
```
docker-compose restart node
```
